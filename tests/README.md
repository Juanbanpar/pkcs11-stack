# Testing

Run unit, property and documentation tests without a PKCS#11 module:

```sh
cargo test --workspace --locked
python3 tools/check-dependencies.py
```

Tests cover URI parsing and redaction, selection ambiguity, ownership, signing
plans, certificate verification, CLI input/output, and TLS signature encoding.
Compile-fail examples check that modules, sessions and objects cannot be used
outside their owner lifetimes.

## SoftHSM integration

Install SoftHSM, OpenSC and OpenSSL, then run:

```sh
./tools/test-softhsm.sh
```

The runner creates temporary token storage and removes it on exit. It provisions
nonextractable RSA/EC keys, runs the ignored integration tests and
[signing/TLS examples](../docs/examples.md), and verifies signatures independently
with OpenSSL. It covers authentication, object mutations, pool recovery, key
replacement, and server/mutual TLS. Use this runner only with SoftHSM, never an
existing token store or a hardware module.

For another SoftHSM installation:

```sh
PKCS11_TEST_MODULE=/path/to/libsofthsm2.so SOFTHSM2_UTIL=/path/to/softhsm2-util ./tools/test-softhsm.sh
```

Set `PKCS11_TEST_REQUIRE_EC_MULTIPART=1` to require combined multipart ECDSA support.
CI tests both packaged SoftHSM and a pinned upstream build with that support.

## Property tests and fuzzing

Increase the case count or choose a seed to reproduce a property failure:

```sh
PROPTEST_RNG_SEED=42 PROPTEST_CASES=4096 cargo test -p pkcs11-locator --test properties --locked
PROPTEST_RNG_SEED=42 PROPTEST_CASES=4096 cargo test -p pkcs11-rustls-adapter --lib encoding::properties --locked
```

Keep minimized failures as regression tests. The [fuzz guide](../fuzz/README.md)
provides sanitizer runs, corpus management and artifact replay commands.

CI checks the workspace and each crate independently, tests minimum Rust versions,
and runs pure tests on Linux, Windows and macOS. SoftHSM and fuzzing run on Linux.
